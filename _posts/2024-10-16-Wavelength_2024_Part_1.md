title: "Journey to Wavelength.. Part 1: Nouns Voting"

## Dear god... the Summit voting phase...

If you've been in the smash scene for a while, you'd have likely experienced the Smash Summit series.
It was an invitational event where the best players in the world would be invited, and some would qualify via events
and others would qualify by voting. Votes you could buy with your own money by purchasing swag from the summit
compendium store. 

As the tradition carried on into later renditions of summit, people would begin doing more and more
for a chance to proceed in the voting round. [Such as Chudat eating a whole raw onion on stream...](https://youtu.be/buZBI-WSwV4?si=imNsqZ66ldCZdOu1) Or 
Nick Yingling selling his car to get in, despite being a relatively unknown Arizona player.
Summit voting phases were notorious for being extremely stressful, putting an immense amount of pressure not only 
on players to get past their round, but the fact that it was their fans and supporters giving their own hard earned
money for just a *chance* for them to get in into the event. Having seen all of the summit voting phases, I told myself that I would never volunteer myself 
for such an arduous voting phase... until the Nouns-Wavelength 2024 voting. 

## Nouns voting rounds

Nouns has been active in the Melee community for the past year and have done a lot for funding players and the community. 
Sponsoring #1 player in the world Cody Schwab and top 10 player Aklo, nouns opened a summit-like voting phase where the top 2 
voted players would earn $1000 USDC to be able to attend Wavelength 2024 in Westford, MA. I'm not above free money, and votes were not decided
by money, but by connecting your discord account, so it shouldn't be very stressful.. or so I thought. 

The first couple of days were pretty calm, as expected, popular European player Nicki was on top of the votes.
He's a fantastic player who just had a great performance at the Eggdog Invitational, so I was effectively fighting for 2nd place. I was doing my best to 
contact all my friends and spread word to get them to vote for me, leading me to be under Nicki and so long as I maintained top 2, I should've been fine.
Or so I thought, that's when I had one of my toughest challenges to overcome... out-campaigning [$40 Cheese String](https://x.com/40CheeseStringg).

## The $40 Underdog

I was not ready for how well $40 Cheese String (we'll call him Garrett from now) was able to leverage his connections
and the incentives he would bring forth to garner votes. Given we were gunning for 2nd place, and because Garrett and I 
were well ahead of the rest of the competition, this campaign ended up being us trying to one-up the other in our incentives
for a whole week on top of how well we could reach out to potential voters. I created a [combo video](https://x.com/GooseKizzle/status/1833675578496475405) and incentive to bring along my friend and fellow top player Faust if we won, the next day Garrett
(responded by hosting a controller giveaway if he won)[https://x.com/40CheeseStringg/status/1833631907638317288], to which I responded with (my own controller giveaway and also a coaching giveaway.)[https://x.com/GooseKizzle/status/1834074583172784639] 
During the last day, we were neck and neck, and I had spent the last 2-3 hours reaching out to anyone I could to help support me in anyway.
It honestly taught me how important of a skill networking and communication are, getting 160+ unique people to take 5 minutes out of their
day to vote for me so I could go attend a tournament in Westford was honestly quite the accomplishment for me already. Winning and getting the $1000 for a chance to prove myself at a major was just the icing on top

Garrett ran a crazy good campaign, especially given he came from a lesser known region for Smash (hailing from Winnipeg),
and managed to get more votes than Southern California's own Salami. I was really happy that despite how tense the voting got
our campaigns remained respectful and honest. I think it's very easy for this kind of tension to devolve into smearing or talking
down on others if left unchecked, but I have only respect for all the people I ran up against. I ended up winning by 20 votes at the end,
Garrett by his own admission didn't capitalize on one of his incentives (a more valuable coaching giveaway than Faust and I could offer),
saving it to the last day where it was too late.  

Looking back on it, it was stressful, anxiety inducing, and overall a very draining process - as everyone who had participated before 
had stated. It ended up taking up so much space in my mind that it was honestly my sole focus for a whole week. Garrett later talked about how it felt
in the Toronto Melee discord chat
> yea its hard when it borderline a one man ship, like of course i had friends spreading the word and shit but they would do that for like 20 mins. meanwhile im sitting here for almost 8 hours a day thinking what person i havent talked to in 2 years can i ask for a vote.
> but otherwise GGs i cant believe i beat out SoCal and went head-to-head against Toronto i cant be sad about getting my name out here 

Massive props to Garrett for running a fierce campaign, it was the first Nouns-round to get really intense with the incentives. For the 
Let's Make Moves Miami round, players did giveaways and challenges, but by far one of the craziest incentives was my [friend Mike Quiggles 
eating a spoonful of Last Dab hot sauce.](https://x.com/SSBM_Quiggles/status/1839770731883720706)
It honestly might've been the craziest voting incentive I've ever seen in Smash period, thank God he got in.

## The Conclusion

Was it a good learning experience? Yes. Am I happy I went through with it? Yes, I was able to attend Wavelength 2024 all-expenses-paid and have one of my best tournament runs ever.
Will I be doing it again? Hell no, but that's also what I said about Summit voting... So who's to say. 

If you made it this far, thank you for reading! Stay tuned for part 2 where I will go over my trip and travelling to the US for the second time for myself!
