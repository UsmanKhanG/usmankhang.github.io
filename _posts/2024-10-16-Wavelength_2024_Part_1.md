title: "Journey to Wavelength.. Part 1: Nouns Voting"

## Dear god... the Summit voting phase...
If you've been in the smash scene for a while, you'd have likely experienced the Smash Summit series.
It was an invitational event where the best players in the world would be invited, and some would qualify via events
and others would qualify by voting. Votes you could buy with your own money by purchasing swag from the summit

voted players would earn $1000 USDC to be able to attend Wavelength 2024 in Westford, MA. I'm not above free money, and votes were not decided
by money, but by connecting your discord account, so it shouldn't be very stressful.. or so I thought. 

The first couple of days were pretty calm, as expected, popular European player Nicki was on top of the votes.
He's a fantastic player who just had a great performance at the Eggdog Invitational, so I was effectively fighting for 2nd place. I was doing my best to 
contact all my friends and spread word to get them to vote for me, leading me to be under Nicki and so long as I maintained top 2, I should've been fine.
Or so I thought, that's when I had one of my toughest challenges to overcome, in
