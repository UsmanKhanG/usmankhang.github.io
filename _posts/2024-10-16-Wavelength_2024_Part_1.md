title: "Journey to Wavelength.. Part 1: Nouns Voting"
---
## Dear god... the voting phase...
If you've been in the smash scene for a while, you'd have likely experienced the Smash Summit series.
It was an invitational event where the best players in the world would be invited, and some would qualify via events
and others would qualify by voting. Votes you could buy with your own money by purchasing swag from the summit
compendium store. 

As the tradition carried on into later renditions of summit, people would begin doing more and more
for a chance to proceed in the voting round. [Such as Chudat eating a whole raw onion on stream](https://youtu.be/buZBI-WSwV4?si=imNsqZ66ldCZdOu1)
